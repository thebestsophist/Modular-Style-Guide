# Extending the Discussion

To write well, you must listen well. By publishing, you build a community of those who read your work. That community can be hard to find when you work in published in a journal or book, but by publishing online, you can see your community within your analytics and comments sections. Care for them. These are the people who cared enough about your work to voice their opinions.

Feedback, comments, and other forms of discussion

Comments often have a bad reputation. Many publications use them, but most do not use them well. It does not have to be so. Carefully curate your participatory audience. Be like the orchardist and ruthlessly cull the hacks, trolls, bigots, and others who use their voice to unfairly discriminate and espouse vitriol.

Do not remove all the comments you do not like, remove the ones that do not expand the discussion. Allow meaningful disagreement, but not ridiculous idiocy. (For instance, if you are writing on public health, you need not entertain the unthinking anti-vaccination crowd.)

If you tend your community well, it will grow to become your audience will not only share your content with others, but can help point you to new avenues to explore. Highlight your best commenters, but not just because people will become more involved when they are acknowledged, but because good content begets more good content.{}
