## What this style guide is for and how to use it
The modular style guide is primarily aimed at written content digital contexts (such as websites and apps), but its rules can be applied to any editorial process. It is a work in progress, but eventually will include default editorial styles for personal writing (such as blogs), business (such as corporate websites), journalism, and scholarship (such as digital academic journals).

My goal here is neither to create a dictionary of rules (such as the New York Times Style Guide), nor to offer a guidebook on good writing (such as F. L. Lucas’s *Style: the Art of Writing Well*). Instead it sits in between, offering a number of rules tailored to digital media with why I believe they are necessary. This style guide will never be comprehensive and is intended to be used in conjunction with a more complete guide such as the Chicago Manual of Style (for scholarship), AP, Economist, or NY Times (for journalism), &c. Underlying its foundation are three basic tenants:

1. Respect your audience.
2. Be as clear as necessary, no less.
3. Editorial mistakes happen, correct them when necessary and move on.

## Anatomy of the Guide
All text is written in markdown, which is automatically formatted into clean html by most web-based git repositories (such as GitHub, BitBucket, and Gitorious). Each section (eg “Grammar”, “Annotations”, and “Typography”) is in a separate folder. Within each folder is `core.md`  which includes content that is generalized across all editorial contexts. There are also context-specific files with rules that are intended for a particular editorial style.
